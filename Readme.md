# Mass_Messanger
Mass messaging using GSM and 8051
Mass Messaging using GSM

************************

Target Hardware: 		8051 microcontroller

************************

Other Requirements:		GSM module, 8051 microcontroller developer board 

************************

Software Requirements: 	Assembly Language IDE (like Keil), ISP software like Sunrom

************************

Project Description:


The primary aim of the project is to create a mass messaging utility to help with the announcements in colleges or just send a message if required. We also know that announcement of notices on a day-to-day basis is a difficult task because transfer of information is not guaranteed. Thus the wireless mass messaging system equipped with a GSM module would prove quite beneficial.
